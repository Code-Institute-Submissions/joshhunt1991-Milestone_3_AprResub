# VG ReviewsTesting

## Manual Testing

Manual testing for this project was performed continually throughout the development process as new features were implemeneted to ensure that features worked and that they didn't have unintended consequences for other previously implemented features. For the purposes of this testing document I am going to perform my manual testing using Heroku, working through the app in a logical order from the landing page.

### Landing page

[- first I tested the navigation links returning to the landing page each time to ensure that all links work from that page.] <br/>
[- Then I tried all of the social media links to ensure that they link to the relevant websites and also that they open in a new window.] <br/>
[- Next I clicked the call to action button to navigate to the registration page] <br/>

### Registration page

[- To get the easy one out of the way first I tested the redirect to the login page button at the bottom of the page.] (/readmelinks/redirect.png)<br/>
[- Then I tried all of the social media links to ensure that they link to the relevant websites and also that they open in a new window.] <br/>
[- Next I clicked the call to action button to navigate to the registration page] <br/>
